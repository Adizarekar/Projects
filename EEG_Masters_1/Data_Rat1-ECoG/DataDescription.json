	"Name":			"Meta-data",
	"Data":			"Intra-cranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings",
	"Animal":		"Wistar adult rat",
	"Ethics approval":	"Conducted in agreement with Uruguay's National Animal Care Law (No. 18611) and with the ``Guide to the care and use of laboratory animals'' (8th edition, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 2010). Furthermore, the Institutional Animal Care Committee (Comisión de Etica en el Uso de Animales) approved the experiments (Exp. No. 070153-000332-16).",
	"Procedure":		"Animals were chronically implanted with electrodes to monitor the states of sleep and wakefulness. Anaesthesia was induced with a mixture of ketamine-xylazine (90 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg i.p., respectively). The rat was positioned in a stereotaxic frame, the skull was exposed, and stainless-steel screw electrodes were placed bilaterally on the skull above motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices, as well as in the right olfactory bulb and cerebellum (Cer), which was taken as the reference electrode. The electrodes were soldered into a 12-pin socket and fixed onto the skull with acrylic cement. At the end of the surgical procedures, an analgesic (Ketoprofen, 1 mg / kg , s.c.) was administered. After the animal had recovered from these surgical procedures, it was left to adapt in a transparent cage (40 x 30 x 20 cm) containing wood shaving material in a temperature-controlled room (21-24 C) for 1 week before recording started.",
	"Experiment": 		"The rat was maintained on a 12hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 07: 00 am) with food and water freely available, and determined to be in good health by veterinarians of the institution. The recordings were performed through a rotating connector, to allow the rat to move freely within the recording box, and conducted during the light period, between 10AM and 4PM UYT. The recording box is sound-attenuated and has a Faraday shield.",
	"Recordings":		"Polysomnographic data were amplified (x1000), acquired and stored in a computer using Dasy Lab Software employing 1024 Hz as a sampling frequency and a 16 bits AD converter. The state of wakefulness (W) was determined in 10s epochs, defined as low-voltage fast-waves in the motor cortex, a strong theta rhythm (4-7 Hz) in the visual cortices, and relatively high EMG activity.",
